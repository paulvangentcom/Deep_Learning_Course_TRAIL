This repository contains the slides and exercises from the two-day deep learning course given at TU Delft on June 5th and 6th.

The lecture and slides have kindly been provided by Dr. Ir. Jan van Gemert.

You can find the exercises and corresponding exercise notebooks in the corresponding folders. The exercise notebooks try to pull their data from one of two webspaces.
